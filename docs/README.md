# Tutorial Service

The Tutorial Service is generated using the Entity Compiler (EC) to demonstrate how the compiler can be used to create a real fully working server application. This is actually one of the modules in the Entity Compiler Tutorial.

This is broken down into the following modules. Each module covers both a data model and an REST API:

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|[`Platform`](Platform/README.md)|This module contains entities associated with a base platform on which functionality is built.|
|[`Tutorial`](Tutorial/README.md)|This module contains entities for building a tutorial system.|
